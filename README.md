# Task-Management-Project

## Overview

This Task Manager project is a Spring Boot application that provides RESTful APIs for managing tasks, users, and authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). The project implements secure user registration and login features with Spring Security and JWT-based authentication.

## Key Features

• User Registration: New users can register by providing their email, password, and other required details.

• User Login: Registered users can log in with their credentials to obtain a JWT token, which is required for accessing protected endpoints.

• JWT Authentication: Secure authentication using JWT tokens, allowing users to access protected resources after successful login.

• Task Management: APIs for creating, updating, and managing tasks (details on task endpoints would be included here).
